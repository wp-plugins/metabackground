I once created this plugin for someone ... they needed to set backgrounds on a per-post basis.

== Description ==

MetaBackGround will let you specify a post background by adding a custom field. This is not the sorcerer's stone, but some users are not comfortable with php and editing of theme files, so all they need to do is install this plugin.


== Installation ==

Installation is simple:

1. Download MetaBackGround
1. Unzip
1. upload to yoursite/wp-content/plugins directory
1. activate

Now all you need to do is write a post. Then add a custom field called **BGIMAGE** and provide the link to your image as value.
**Tip**: you can upload an image via the image upload function. Upon upload, you'll immediately see the link to the image you just uploaded. Copy it and paste into the custom field value.

== Changelog ==

January 17, 2009 - **Version 1.0**

* My wife's birthday. I release this plugin.
